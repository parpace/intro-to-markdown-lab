Utilizing the Terminal can make the creation, navigation, and deletion of directories and files very fast and efficient. After a little bit of practice, you'll discover why professionals prefer using Terminal to navigate their computers.

## 1. Open the Terminal

Since you already read my guide to installing and setting up the Terminal, go ahead and click on that Terminal icon in your taskbar! If you are still struggling and need some guidance, here are some extra tips:

1. Look for and identify the _Terminal_ icon. It looks something like this!

2. Position your mouse directly over the Terminal icon.
3. Left click whilst the mouse is hovering over the Terminal icon.

Great job! The Terminal popped up on your screen. Let's figure out what to do inside!
 

## 2. Know Your Icons

If you followed my setup instructions, you should be greeted with a couple of symbols that look like this `➜  ~`

* This `➜` arrow is __green__ for now. If you input something that cannot be executed, it will change to __red__. If you give it an input that is successfully executed, it will remain green!
* This `~` squiggle here just shows you what line you are inputting on, and leaves a trail of squiggles for every input that you entered.

## 3. Create a file

We will go over 2 commands for creating things inside of our Terminal. I know we're moving really fast now, so hold on....  These 2 commands are `mkdir` and `touch` 

* `mkdir` is used to create a ___directory___. To use this command, simply input `mkdir` followed by whatever you would like to name the folder.

#### Example: 
```
mkdir ImSoSmart
``` 
This input would create a file named "_ImSoSmart_" in your current directory.

* `touch` is used to create a _file_. To use this command, simply input `touch` folowed by the name of the file that you would like to create.

#### Example: 
```
touch ImSmarder.html
``` 
This input would create a HTML file dubbed "_ImSmarder_" in your current directory.
